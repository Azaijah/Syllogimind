# Syllogimind

*NOTE: This project is early on in development and everything is subject to change

Syllogimind is a application developed in Go, designed to engage users in enhancing their logical reasoning capabilities through the generation and solving of syllogisms. Grounded in Relational Frame Theory (RFT), a psychological theory of human language and cognition, Syllogimind offers a unique approach to developing cognitive skills. RFT posits that humans learn language and cognition through the relational linking of concepts, and Syllogimind leverages this theory to provide a powerful educational tool.

## Features

- **Integration with Relational Frame Theory**: Applies RFT principles to foster cognitive development, making it an ideal tool for educational purposes and mental training.
- **Dynamic Entity and Relationship Generation**: Automatically generates entities and their relational frameworks to create varied syllogisms, ensuring a challenging and enriching experience with each use.
- **Educational Utility**: Acts as a resourceful platform for psychology students, educators, and anyone interested in cognitive psychology and enhancing their reasoning skills.

## Installation

Before installing Syllogimind, make sure you have Go installed on your system. You can download and install Go from [the official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

To get started with Syllogimind, clone the repository to your local machine:

```

Navigate to the Syllogimind directory:

```bash
cd Syllogimind
```

Compile the application:

```bash
go build
```

## Usage

To run Syllogimind and start generating syllogisms:

```bash
./Syllogimind
```

Upon execution, Syllogimind will dynamically create entities and establish relationships between them to form logical premises and conclusions, presenting a stimulating cognitive challenge to the user.


## Example Output

```
BAP is less than ZIG
QOX is less than ZIG
